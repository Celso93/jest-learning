# What are software test.
- Code that made assertons and checks
- Testes are requirements/specifications
- What is a unit ? smallest part of code that can be tested
    - Methods
    - Class
    - Module

# Why we need autmated tests ?
- Peace of mind as a developer/tester
- Win 3 hours of debugging
- Unit test impose high code quality
    - if a unit is too dificult to test, the code quality should be improved
- Prevent endless manual tests
- Think big: A TODO list doesn't tests
